# Gallows

This is a simple Phoenix app that makes it easy to play a nice Hangman game.

The app contains only the logic necessary for getting the user input and displaying the results of his guesses.

All the logic for implementing the hangman game is stored separately in its own library which is imported into the Phoenix app.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/hangman`](http://localhost:4000/hangman) from your browser to start the game.
